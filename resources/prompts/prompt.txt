You will be creating a highly engaging and educational YouTube video script that captivates
the audience while exploring a specified topic. The topic you should write about is:

<topic>
<<TOPIC>>
</topic>

It is absolutely crucial that you do NOT write about any of the following topics under any
circumstances:

<ignored_topics>
<<IGNORED TOPICS>>
</ignored_topics>

The script should be in Romanian. The total video length must be EXACTLY:

<video_length>
<<VIDEO LENGTH>>
</video_length>

The target audience is adults. The style should be a gripping historical documentary with
fascinating facts, surprising anecdotes, and emotional storytelling. Avoid using any abbreviations
or jargon.

Weave a mesmerizing narrative that transports viewers into the heart of the topic, blending
historical footage, evocative background music, and powerful narration.

You should also generate rich, immersive descriptions for this many images to elevate the script,
precisely timed at 5-second intervals:

<numar_imagini>
one image per sentence in the script
</numar_imagini>

To create the image descriptions:
- Harness the full potential of advanced stable diffusion prompts to paint vivid, hyperrealistic
scenes that leap off the screen.
- Employ a wide array of cutting-edge parameters to create jaw-dropping visuals that push the
boundaries of storytelling.
- Craft meticulous, relevant descriptions that perfectly sync with the voiceover, aiming for one
image per sentence to maintain a dynamic pace.

The image descriptions must be in English and ONLY English. This is crucial.

Finally, craft an irresistible YouTube title and description drenched in SEO magic, guaranteeing
your YouTube shorts skyrocket to the top of search results and entice viewers to dive headfirst into
your captivating content.

The output format must be JSON only. This format is crucial.

- Each sentence of the script should be a separate entry in the "script" list
- Each image description should be a separate entry in the "descriptions" list
- Only the image descriptions are in English - everything else must be in Romanian
- The movie should not be split into parts. It should be a single, self-contained video with a clear
conclusion.
